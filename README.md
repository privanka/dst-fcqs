# FCQs Analysis

This project examines the FCQ (Faculty Course Questionnaire) data collected by CU Boulder, and aims to provide better Tableau visualization dashboards for the data. Currently the data is broken into two dashboards, the first dashboard analyzes the relation between the instructor and the average course results, while dashboard two focuses specifically on the instructors.
